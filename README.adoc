= SolarView
Docker image for the SolarView main application

== Description
This project contains the configuration to build a Docker image for the http://www.solarview.info/solarview_linux.aspx[SolarView main application] with GitLab CI.

== Usage
Build this project with GitLab CI. The build will

* create Docker images for the platforms `linux/i386` and `linux/arm/v7`
* add labels
* tag them with version and date and
* publish them to the Docker registry.

SolarView uses `curl` for FTP and `CSmtp` for mail. Since the binaries in the original SolarView package are quite outdated, they are replaced by an up-to-date `curl` and a drop-in replacement for `CSmtp` that uses `curl` under the hood.
